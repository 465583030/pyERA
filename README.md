Python implementation of the Epigenetic Robotic Architecture (ERA). It includes standalone classes for Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Hebbian Leaning.


What is ERA?
------------

The Epigenetic Robotic Architecture (ERA) is a hybrid behavior-based robotics and neural architecture purposely built to implement embodied principles in cognitive development. This architecture has been already tested in a variety of cognitive and developmental tasks directly modeling child psychology data. The ERA architecture uses a behaviour-based subsumption mechanism to handle the integration of competing sensorimotor input. The learning system is based on an ensemble of pre-trained Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) connected via Hebbian weights. Various SOMs perform vision, motor and speech classification tasks and learn hierarchical associations between modalities. During interaction with the users in a learning phase, the connections weights between different modalities are trained via Hebbian rule.
